/** \brief General tracker processor
 *
 * This is an abstract class.
 *
 * This class implements the incremental tracker, that can be used to track either Features in
 * other Captures, or Landmarks in a Map, through two derived classes,
 *   - ProcessorTrackerFeature,
 *   - ProcessorTrackerLandmark.
 *
 * The incremental tracker contains three pointers to three Captures of type CaptureBase,
 * named \b origin, \b last and \b incoming:
 *   - \b origin: this points to a Capture where all Feature tracks start.
 *   - \b last: the last Capture tracked by the tracker.
 *     A sufficient subset of the Features in \b origin is still alive in \b last.
 *   - \b incoming: the capture being received. The tracker operates on this Capture,
 *     establishing correspondences between the features here and the features in \b origin.
 *     Each successful correspondence
 *     results in an extension of the track of the Feature up to the \b incoming Capture.
 *
 * It establishes constraints Feature-Feature or Feature-Landmark;
 * Implement these options in two separate derived classes:
 *   - ProcessorTrackerFeature : for Feature-Feature correspondences (no landmarks)
 *   - ProcessorTrackerLandmark : for Feature-Landmark correspondences (with landmarks)
 *
 * The pipeline of actions for an autonomous tracker can be resumed as follows (see process() for full detail).
 * We highlight the functions to be implemented by derived classes with the sign '<=== IMPLEMENT'
 *   - On each incoming Capture,
 *     - Track known features in the \b incoming Capture: processKnown()            <=== IMPLEMENT
 *     - Check if enough Features are still tracked, and vote for a new KeyFrame if this number is too low:
 *     - if voteForKeyFrame()                                                       <=== IMPLEMENT
 *       - Populate the tracker with new Features : processNew()                    <=== IMPLEMENT
 *       - Make a KeyFrame with the \b last Capture: makeFrame(), setKey()
 *       - Establish constraints of the new Features: establishConstraints()        <=== IMPLEMENT
 *       - Reset the tracker with the \b last Capture as the new \b origin: reset() <=== IMPLEMENT
 *     - else
 *       - Advance the tracker one Capture ahead: advance()                         <=== IMPLEMENT
 *
 * This functionality exists by default in the virtual method process().
 * Should you need extra functionality for your derived types, you can overload the two methods,
 *
 *   -  preProcess() { }
 *   -  postProcess() { }
 *
 * which are called at the beginning and at the end of process(). See the doc of these functions for more info.

         *
         * This should do one of the following, depending on the design of the tracker -- see use_landmarks_:
         *   - Track Features against other Features in the \b origin Capture. Tips:
         *     - An intermediary step of matching against Features in the \b last Capture makes tracking easier.
         *     - Once tracked against last, then the link to Features in \b origin is provided by the Features' Constraints in \b last.
         *     - If required, correct the drift by re-comparing against the Features in origin.
         *     - The Constraints in \b last need to be transferred to \b incoming (moved, not copied).
         *   - Track Features against Landmarks in the Map. Tips:
         *     - The links to the Landmarks are in the Features' Constraints in last.
         *     - The Constraints in \b last need to be transferred to \b incoming (moved, not copied).
         *
         * The function must generate the necessary Features in the \b incoming Capture,
         * of the correct type, derived from FeatureBase.
